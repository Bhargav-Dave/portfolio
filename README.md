## Work Experience

### **Data Engineer**
**Tattle Civic Tech** | Gurgaon, India  
*Aug. 2022 – Jul. 2023*  
- Developed **Uli**, a browser extension using Machine Learning to mitigate online gender-based violence, serving hundreds from marginalized communities.  
- Trained NLP models in Python, managing a database of over 250+ slurs across three Indian languages, and optimized algorithm performance with approximate slur matching.  
- Led data cleaning, wrangling, and CI/CD pipeline creation for the extension.  
- Designed adaptive logic for a digital card game using ReactJS and Python, creating data pipelines to feed game artworks dynamically.

### **Research Intern**
**Dhirubhai Ambani Inst. of Information and Communication Technology** | Gandhinagar, India  
*Jan. 2022 – Jul. 2022*  
- Simulated opinion dynamics in elections using agent-based social models on complex networks with Python, scaling to graphs with over 1M nodes.  
- Extended research on social effects, such as voter dejection and abstention, in large-scale simulations.  
- Received the **Best B.Tech Project Award 2022**.

### **Summer Research Intern**
**Dhirubhai Ambani Inst. of Information and Communication Technology** | Gandhinagar, India  
*Apr. 2021 – Jul. 2021*  
- Investigated astrophysical accretion in black holes using fluid mechanics.  
- Reviewed literature on General Relativity simulations and developed Python scripts to model supermassive black hole accretion disks.
